Sets used for training. 

For the validation set only:

  Identical filenames for the clean speech and noise must be placed in 'val_clean_speech' 
  and 'val_noise', with the SNR at the end of the filename. The format of the filename is: 
  'x_y_zdB', where 'x' is the clean speech, 'y' is the noise source and z is the SNR level. 
  The clean speech and noise will be mixed together at the SNR level specified in the filename

  As an example:
  './val_clean_speech/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav' contains the clean speech, 
  and './val_noise/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav' contains the noise. The number 
  of samples in each must be identical. 

  This must be done, as the clean speech and noise used to create the noisy speech 
  (noisy speech = clean speech + noise) are required to compute the a priori SNR target.
