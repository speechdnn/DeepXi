Sets used for training. 

For the validation set only:

  Identical filenames for the clean speech and noise must be placed in 'val_clean_speech' 
  and 'val_noise', with the SNR at the end of the filename. The format of the filenames is: 
  'x_y_zdB.wav', where 'x' is the clean speech name, 'y' is the noise source name and 'z' is the SNR level. 
  The clean speech and noise will be mixed together at the SNR level specified in the filename during 
   validation

  As an example:
  './val_clean_speech/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav' contains the clean speech, 
  and './val_noise/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav' contains the noise.
  
  Please note that the number of samples in the clean speech and noise must be identical.

  This must be done, as the clean speech and noise used to create the noisy speech 
  (noisy speech = clean speech + noise) are required to compute the a priori SNR target.
